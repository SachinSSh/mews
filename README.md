## TODO: 
* Read from DB
* Generate UI as well
* Option for WHERE the created project gets stored on user's computer.
* Get the autopep8 command to work on ONLY the project.
* Better how to use instructions.
* Environment management for imported packages and server set-up.
* Test to see if the code will actually work. (Mostly blocked by imported packages right now).
* Answer questions: Create as a framework; value as a framework. What is already debugged? What does the developer have to do / doesn't have to do?
* How do these get deployed? How does it get taken to production?
